# Through the Darkness of Space

## Description
This is a Space Exploration Game that uses Newtonian Mechanics to simulate Planets and Moons revolving around their parent Sun and to provide realistic landings and takeoffs from a Planet in a 2D environment.
All the orbits, colours and missions are randomly generated, so each playthrough will be different!

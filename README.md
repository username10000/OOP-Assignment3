## Project Abstract
### Introduction
This project aims to deliver a Space Exploration Game that uses Newtonian Mechanics to simulate the Planets revolving around their parent Sun and to provide realistic landings and takeoffs from a Planet in a 2D environment. 

### Language
The game will be written in C++ using the SFML Library for Window, Graphics and Audio management. It will use Object-Oriented Programming principles such as polymorphism, abstract classes and inheritance. SFML also uses this principles which will make the project have a more uniform look.
